#Conway's Game of Life

There are six starting configurations available at the command line.
They are called using `./GameOfLife.py -f <config>`, where `<config>` is one of the following:

* random
* blinker
* pentadecathlon
* pulsar
* toad
* beacon

In the "random" case, cells will be filled uniformly according to a random distribution.
The number of filled cells is specified using the `-n` command line option.
Exit using ctrl-C.
